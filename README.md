=============

A collection of plugins for Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) related to Zookeeper, to include:

- Zookeeper Input step, for reading configuration data stored in Zookeeper
- Zookeeper Output step, for storing configuration data in Zookeeper
- Spoon plugin for managing your Zookeeper data (uses the zooviewer project at https://code.google.com/p/zooviewer/)
 
Here's the long-term wishlist (if you'd like to contribute):
- Extension point plugin for dynamically loading cluster schemas from Zookeeper (will help manage Carte clusters)
- Zookeeper-backed PDI Repository
